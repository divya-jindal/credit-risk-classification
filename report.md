## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, I used machine learning models to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending activity data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The purpose of the analysis was to identify the most accurate model for predicting healthy loans (0) and high-risk loans (1).

The data consisted of various financial information, including loan status, interest rate, borrower income, credit score, and more. I needed to predict the loan status, which was represented by a binary variable (0 for healthy loans and 1 for high-risk loans).

The loan_status variable had a value count of 15001 healthy loans and 507 high-risk loans. I went through the stages of data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and model evaluation as part of this analysis. I used the Logistic Regression algorithm to train the model.

## Results

Machine Learning Model 1 (Logistic Regression):
* Accuracy: 0.99
* Precision: 1.00 (for healthy loans), 0.86 (for high-risk loans)
* Recall: 0.99 (for healthy loans), 0.94 (for high-risk loans)
* F1-score: 1.00 (for healthy loans), 0.90 (for high-risk loans)

## Summary

Based on the results, the Logistic Regression model performed extremely well in predicting both healthy loans and high-risk loans. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.99, indicating that it correctly predicted the loan status in almost all cases.

The precision and recall scores also indicate that the model was highly accurate in predicting both healthy loans and high-risk loans. The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was also high for both classes.

I would recommend using the Logistic Regression model for predicting loan status, as it performed well in both precision and recall. The high accuracy and F1-scores indicate that the model is reliable and can be used to make informed decisions about lending.
